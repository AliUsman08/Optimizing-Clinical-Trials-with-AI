# Implementing AI for Clinical Trial Applications

In this GitHub repository I have made three AI models to help optimize clinical trials. The first model labelled `Clinical_Trial_Outcome_Prediction.ipynb` utilizes the Pytrial librabry to output a result from 0 to 1 indicating whether a clinical trial will fail or succeed. The second model` Patient_Outcome_Prediction ` is also a result from 0 to 1 and tells us how a patient will react to a treatment administered during a clinical trial. Lastly, `Trial_Similarity_Search.ipynb` matches a clinical trial with five other trial that are similar and this can help with trial design.

For more information here's an article on how you can also implement AI in clinical trial applications:[ bit.ly/optimizing-clinical-trials-with-AI](url)
